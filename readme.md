# Tik Tok Game

### Design a tik tok game which will be driven completely by a config. Each stage of the game will have an n x n matrix of boxes. Following are the rules :-

#

1. One box in the matrix will be highlighted till the user clicks on it or the time gets over.
   Highlighted boxes will keep on changing randomly.
2. If the user clicks on the highlighted matrix, he will be rewarded with some points given in the configuration.
3. If the user clicks on a non-highlighted matrix, some points will be deducted from his total score.
4. Every stage will have a passing score (Given in the configuration).
5. If the user reaches the passing score, the next stage of the game will be triggered.
6. Once the user passes the last stage, we will have to congratulate him with some animation.

## Note:

##### Use only native/vanilla JS. Please refrain from using any external plugins, frameworks or libraries.
